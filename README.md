# basketball-reference

Scrapes basketball-reference.com all the time, extracts information to a database, provides REST API.

# TODO

1. Look at structure of pages:
  * Leagues (NBA, ABA at least)
  * Schedule
  * Standings (Division & Conference)
  * Box Scores
  * Draft
  * Coaches
  * Awards
2. Develop database architecture for this structure
3. Determine which pages actually have to be scraped and which information may be calculated from those. This is to avoid possible inconsistencies.
4. Start coding

# Structure of BBall-Ref

Which sites to scrape for what information? Note that everything is inside ``"div#page_content"``.

Variables, denoted with {CURLYBRACES_CAPSLOCK}:
* **3LETTERABBREV**: three letter abbrevation of the team, e.g. CHI for Chicago Bulls.
* **YEAR**: you know that...

## Players

* All players: ``/players/[a-z]``
* Single player: ``"tr[data-row] a:first"`` on players page

### General information

Everything is inside ``"div#info_box"``.

* Image: ``"div.person_image > img"``
* Name: ``"div.person_image_offset > h1"``
* Birth: ``"div.person_image_offset > p > span#necro-birth[data-birth]"``
* Numbers: ``"div.person_image_offset > div.uni_holder a > span[tip]"`` for team and years and ``textContent`` for actual number.

Everything else weirdly intertwined in ``"div.person_image_offset > p"``. That is:

* Position
* Shooting hand
* Height
* Weight
* Birthplace
* High school
* College
* Draft information

### Statistics

* Totals: ``"div.stw#all_totals tr[data-row] > td"``
* Per Game: ``"div.stw#all_per_game tr[data-row] > td"``
* Per Minute: ``"div.stw#all_per_minute tr[data-row] > td"``
* Advanced: ``"div.stw#all_advanced tr[data-row] > td"``
* Playoffs: ``"div.stw#all_playoffs_totals tr[data-row] > td"``
* Playoffs Per Game: ``"div.stw#all_playoffs_per_game tr[data-row] > td"``
* Playoffs Per Minute: ``"div.stw#all_playoffs_per_minute tr[data-row] > td"``
* Playoffs Advanced: ``"div.stw#all_playoffs_advanced tr[data-row] > td"``
* College: ``"div.stw#all_college tr[data-row] > td"``

TODO: Check how columns differ among those tables.

### Misc

* Similarity Scores: ``"div#all_sim_scores > div#div_sim_career tr[data-row] > td"``
* Awards: ``"div#all_leaderboards_other > table#leaderboard tr > td > div > div > span" textContent`` gives type of award (All-Star Games, Awards, Championships, Minutes Playedâ€¦). From there it's a bunch of links followed by text followed by breakline.
* Transactions: ``"div.stw#all_transactions > div#transactions > p > span.bold_text"`` contains the date, afterwards is a description of the transaction.
* Salaries: ``"div.stw#all_salaries > div#div_salaries > table#salaries tr[data-row] > td"``

## Teams

* Active teams: ``"table#active tr[data-row] > td:first"`` if it's a link, then there is a team site to it.
* Defunct teams: Same with ``table#defuct``.
